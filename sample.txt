üìí PingSSO Onboarding ‚Äî Standard Process Notes

1. Purpose

The PingSSO onboarding process allows an internal or external application to integrate with the enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) platform. It ensures that authentication, authorization, and identity management are handled consistently across the enterprise.

‚∏ª

2. Stakeholders
	‚Ä¢	Application Team (the consumer) ‚Äî requests onboarding.
	‚Ä¢	PingSSO Platform Team ‚Äî manages SSO configurations and approvals.
	‚Ä¢	Security / Risk ‚Äî reviews compliance aspects.
	‚Ä¢	Product Owner (PO) ‚Äî approves integration for their business unit.

‚∏ª

3. Environments

Onboarding typically happens per environment:
	‚Ä¢	Development (Dev)
	‚Ä¢	Test / SIT (System Integration Testing)
	‚Ä¢	Staging / UAT
	‚Ä¢	Production (Prod)

Each environment may require its own Client ID/Secret and approvals.

4. Requests & Forms

Three standard requests/forms must be raised (often via ServiceNow / Jira or internal portals):
	1.	New Onboarding Request (OAuth)
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: to create an application profile in PingSSO.
	‚Ä¢	Details needed:
	‚Ä¢	Application name & description
	‚Ä¢	Business unit
	‚Ä¢	Environment (Dev / SIT / Staging / Prod)
	‚Ä¢	Redirect URIs / callback URLs
	‚Ä¢	Grant types (e.g., Authorization Code, Client Credentials)
	‚Ä¢	Scopes required
	‚Ä¢	Contact details of the owning team
	2.	NSSR (New Shared Secret Request)
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: to request Client ID / Client Secret.
	‚Ä¢	Raised per environment.
	‚Ä¢	Requires justification for secret usage and handling policy.
	3.	GLAM/GWAM Access Request
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: to request access for application teams to manage secrets and credentials.
	‚Ä¢	Covers: who can retrieve/manage the secret from the vault.

‚∏ª

5. Typical Workflow
	1.	Application team raises New Onboarding Request (OAuth).
	2.	PingSSO team reviews details, validates redirect URIs, scopes, compliance.
	3.	PingSSO team provisions app profile in requested environment(s).
	4.	Application team raises NSSR to get Client ID/Secret.
	5.	Security validation may happen for Prod requests.
	6.	GLAM/GWAM requests are raised for the right team members.
	7.	Secrets delivered securely (via vault or secret manager).
	8.	Integration testing done in Dev ‚Üí SIT ‚Üí Staging.
	9.	Go-Live in Production after approvals and sign-off.

‚∏ª

6. Information Checklist (must be prepared by Application Team)
	‚Ä¢	Business Unit name and contacts
	‚Ä¢	Application name & description
	‚Ä¢	Environment(s) requested
	‚Ä¢	Redirect URIs (with HTTPS)
	‚Ä¢	Grant types and flows required (Auth Code, Client Credentials, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Scopes required
	‚Ä¢	Expected user base (internal staff, external customers, service accounts)
	‚Ä¢	Justification for scopes/secrets
	‚Ä¢	Contact group / distribution list for future changes

‚∏ª

7. Timelines & Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Dev/SIT onboarding: usually quick (1‚Äì2 days).
	‚Ä¢	Staging/Prod onboarding: may require security/risk approval (adds 1‚Äì2 weeks).
	‚Ä¢	Dependencies: application must support OAuth 2.0/OIDC standards.
	‚Ä¢	Secrets: must be rotated periodically (policy-driven).
	‚Ä¢	Audit: all requests and approvals are tracked for compliance.

‚∏ª

8. Common Pitfalls
	‚Ä¢	Missing or incorrect redirect URIs (most frequent rejection cause).
	‚Ä¢	Requesting unnecessary scopes (security review pushback).
	‚Ä¢	Not aligning secret management with enterprise policy (e.g., trying to store secrets in code).
	‚Ä¢	Raising Prod onboarding before testing in lower environments.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ In summary:
The PingSSO onboarding process requires three key requests (OAuth app profile, NSSR for secrets, GLAM/GWAM for access), environment-wise approvals, and close coordination with the PingSSO team. Prepare redirect URIs, scopes, and contacts up front to avoid delays.

Do you want me to format this as a step-by-step checklist (like an internal runbook) that your engineers/POs can follow, or keep it as explanatory notes?
