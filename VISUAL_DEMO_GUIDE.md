# 🎨 Ping SSO Onboarding Agent - Visual Demo Guide

## 🎯 **Visual Demo with React Flow**

I've created a **beautiful, interactive visual demo** using React Flow that shows the complete Ping SSO onboarding workflow with real-time animations, approval gates, and evidence tracking.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

```bash
# Navigate to visual demo
cd visual-demo

# Setup (one-time)
./setup.sh

### **Color-coded States**
- **Gray**: Not Started
- **Yellow**: Forms Raised
- **Blue**: Credentials Issued
- **Green**: Access Provisioned
- **Purple**: Validated
- **Pink**: Sign-off Sent
- **Green**: Approved
- **Dark Green**: Complete
- **Red**: Blocked/Changes Requested

### **Evidence Badges**
- **🎫 Tickets**: NSSR, GLAM, GWAM tickets
- **🔑 Secrets**: Masked credential references
- **📷 Screenshots**: Login, consent, landing, token
- **📧 Emails**: Sign-off and approval emails

### **Approval Gates**
- **Dashed Borders**: Indicate approval requirements
- **Approver Lists**: Shows who needs to approve

- **Status Updates**: Approved/rejected with timestamps

## 🎯 **Demo Scripts**

### **Automated Demo (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Click "Play" button
# Watch the complete flow from start to finish
# States progress automatically every 2 seconds
# Activity log shows real-time updates
```

### **Manual Demo (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Use "Step Forward" for each transition
# Explain what happens at each step:
# 1. "Onboard Galaxy" → Creates thread and tickets
# 2. "Credentials Issued" → Stores masked secrets
# 3. "Access Provisioned" → GLAM/GWAM completed
# 4. "Validation Complete" → All screenshots captured
# 5. "Sign-off Sent" → Email sent to approvers
# 6. "Dev Approved" → Human approval granted
# 7. "Dev Complete" → Ready for next environment
# 8. "Start Staging" → Begin staging environment
```

### **Interactive Demo (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Let audience control the demo
# Ask them to click "Step Forward"
# Explain each state as it appears
# Show evidence collection and approval gates
# Demonstrate different client scenarios
```

## 🎨 **Customization Options**

### **Adding New States**
```javascript
// Add to STATES object in App.js
NEW_STATE: { id: 'new-state', label: 'New State', color: 'new-state' }

// Add corresponding CSS class
.state-node.new-state {
  background: #your-color;
  border-color: #your-border-color;
  color: #your-text-color;
}
